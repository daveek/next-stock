ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Welcome to my solution for excersise proposed. It's not 100% perfect, but it meets the requirements.

This is the solution for the Frontend Excercise, and it was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.9. And With Angular Material to support the styles, look & feel.

## Install dependencies
- Run `npm i` to install all the dependencies

## Development server
 - Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build and Deployment in Docker ðŸš€ 

There is a option to deploy the app inside a docker container, for this:
 - Run `./build.sh` to build the image
 - Run `docker-compose up -d ` to run the container

### then you should navigate to the `http://localhost:8080/` where the Nginx is serving

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests with coverage

Run `ng test --code-coverage` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). The coverage will be displayed in the console, as well you can navigate in the browser throught this url: `./coverage/next-stock/index.html`

## Git Log of commits

- You can find here: `commits-log.txt` all the logs of the commits, I have made during this solution.
